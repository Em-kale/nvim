Just my personal Nvim configuration - includes LSP, fuzzyfinder, undo tree, pretty colours, etc. 

Note: as of March 2024, you must use the recent, unstable version of nvim or it will explode 

Other things you will need to install manually as of now to get this working:
    - npm 
    - prettier, if you want it (via npm) 
    - ripgrep

Orginally based on the primeagen's nvim 0 to LSP guide (though it drifts, and the LSP configuration is probably entirely different).
